    <h1>Basque Cheesecake</h1>
        <img src="../images/cheesecake-basque.jpeg" alt="Basque Cheesecake">
        <p>I rarely post a trendy recipe while it's still trendy. But this 'burnt' cheesecake method deserved the hype; baking it in a very hot<br>oven delivers a beautiful, dark exterior full of bittersweet notes that make the light, creamy cheesecake interior seem even more<br>rich and flavorful. Plus, this method is just plain easier--just remember the parchment paper. So, if you've not had much luck with<br>traditional cheesecake methods, you should stop trying and make this exclusively.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 extra large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Basque Cheesecake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Butter a 9-inch cake pan. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to line the inside of the pan by a few extra inches.<br> Butter the paper and press it into the pan, flattening any major creases. Trim away any excess paper from the sides until<br> you have an inch or two of overhang.</li>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, salt, and flour in a bowl. Stir and smear together with a spatula until very smooth and creamy.<br> Add vanilla extract and 1 egg; whisk to combine. Whisk in remaining eggs, one at a time. Pour in heavy cream and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan. Tap the pan against the counter to burst any excess air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, very well browned, and nearly burned on the edges, 50 to 55 minutes. Increase oven<br> temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) in the last 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cheesecake cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes. Lift out onto a plate and peel back parchment paper, using a knife<br> or spatula if needed. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
